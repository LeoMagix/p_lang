For all the wonder of things I can birth from my mind to reality.
I am a fanatic for logic, what better way to satisfy a logical thinker than programming.
If you love maths, logic like I do then it's a no brainer.
It gives me the opportunity to innovate.
It provides me with way to satisfy my passion for learning, knowledge.
Because I can truly contribute to further improve human living and the world in general.
Because Engineering is me, and it provides the opportunity venture deeper into various aspects of engineering.
